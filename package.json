  "description": "Build an API Orchestrator Library in TypeScript (30-Day GitHub Commit Challenge)\r Project Goal: Create a lightweight, framework-agnostic TypeScript library called \"api-orchestrator-ts\" that simplifies managing complex API workflows in modern apps. Target devs building SaaS, e-com, or AI backends who struggle with chaining multiple API calls (e.g., auth → payment → notification), handling errors, retries, rate limits, and fallbacks without brittle custom code. Inspired by better-auth's plug-and-play vibe, make this lib declarative and extensible to slash integration time and boost reliability. Open-source it on GitHub, commit every day for 30 days to build momentum, gather feedback, and aim for 1k+ stars by solving a universal dev frustration.\r Core Problem It Solves: In 2025, apps rely on distributed systems with multiple APIs, but orchestrating them is chaos—cascading failures from one bad call, manual retries/backoffs, auth token refreshes, and no easy way to log/monitor flows. Existing tools (Axios for basics, AWS Step Functions for cloud-locked overkill) leave gaps. Your lib fills this: a simple orchestrate API for defining flows, auto-handling resilience, and plugins for common services like Stripe or Twilio.\r Key Features to Implement:",
